# “Nothing will fundamentally change” – What the Left can learn from the 2022 US Midterms
 
“Nothing will fundamentally change”— that’s what Joseph R. Biden told wealthy Democratic donors in June 2019 while campaigning for the White House. It was a reassurance that Biden’s economic measures would not burden higher earners as much as his critics on the right had warned they would.   
 
As we exit 2022 and welcome 2023, President Biden is riding a wave of optimism following an unexpectedly positive outcome in the November Congressional Midterms. The Democrats were generally expected to lose control of the Senate and the House of Representatives, with the latter being by a massive margin  
 
Talk of a ‘red tsunami’ was rife in the runup to the election, with rampant inflation seeming to be the crest of the wave that would wipe away Biden’s chance of being anything other than a lame-duck president for the remainder of his term. And then, the tsunami turned out to be a ripple.  
 
It cannot even be called a ‘red wave’. The Democrats actually gained a seat in the Senate, giving them an outright majority, and only lost nine seats in the House - a broadly positive outcome considering the somewhat dire projections leading up to the election. For the left, both in America and worldwide, the results of the Midterms are sure to be seen as a mixed bag.  
 
On the one hand, the results seem to represent the beginning of a long overdue rejection of Trump’s brand of bigoted populism. Over half of Trump-endorsed candidates lost their respective races – including Mehmet Oz, whose defeat in Pennsylvania secured the Democratic majority in the Senate.  
 
Of course, Trump himself is still more relevant than ever, having recently announced his 2024 presidential bid. However, it seems as though his racist and divisive rhetoric is coming back to bite him. This is a trend likely to be bolstered by the role of the January 6th Committee, which recently attributed to him the blame for the infamous Capitol riots.
 
It appears as though traditional Republican voters have sought to distance themselves from the more extreme views of MAGA voters, and as such, have punished the GOP for allowing the virus that is Trumpism to spread throughout their party.  
 
It is also important not to underestimate the role of Roe vs Wade in this election. The landmark ruling which granted a constitutional right to abortion across the US was struck down by the Supreme Court in June, leading to massive public outcry. This anachronistic restriction of bodily autonomy for half the population proved to be a deciding factor in the elections.  
 
Newly registered women made up more than half of newly registered voters at the Midterms, and polling by AP VoteCast showed that 60% of voters were angry with the Court’s decision to overturn Roe. This mobilisation of women in favour of the Democrats is ultimately what saved them, as abortion proved a crucial issue in key battlegrounds such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.  
 
Evidently, the two key factors that made the Midterms such a disappointment for the Republicans, and such a surprising victory for the Democrats, were the legacy of Trump and the striking down of Roe. Neither of those factors can be called a true victory for the left.  
 
A victory for Biden over Trump, whilst preferable, is still a victory of the lesser of two evils – Biden and the Democrats have already made it clear that ‘nothing will fundamentally change’ in their approach to governing. It is unlikely that these results will galvanise the president into taking drastic action to improve living standards, tackle the climate crisis, and reduce income inequality. If he didn’t act whilst he held the House, why would he do it now that he’s lost it? 
 
That is not to say that nothing at all will change as Biden enters the final two years of his first term. In October, his administration pardoned everyone with federal convictions of marijuana possession, in what is likely a move towards full federal decriminalisation. Biden also announced a student loan debt relief plan, seeking to forgive up to \$20,000 in student debt for tens of millions of Americans.  
 
It’s clear that with Biden in office, especially with at least one chamber of Congress supporting him, the potential for fundamental change is vast. However, the will to do so just isn’t there.  
 
The stunted political spectrum of the United States has always favoured right-wing politics, making it extremely rare for any federal election to truly be encouraging for the left, and 2022 was no exception. The Democrats won, but at what cost? Millions of women no longer have access to safe abortions, and Congress continues to be occupied by two parties who do not fight for unions, communitarianism, common ownership, or fundamental wealth redistribution.  
 
However, no matter how bleak the picture may be, it is important that we do not lose faith in a better future. House Republicans haplessly collapsed in on themselves as they scrambled to elect a new Speaker of the House, only succeeding after a long-drawn-out process where 15 ballots had to be organised. The process has highlighted deep divisions within the GOP.  
 
If he can portray the Republicans as the party of chaos and confusion, Biden has the potential to rally public support behind a clear agenda of change. The change in question may not be as far-reaching, radical, or effective as we may have hoped, but I believe it is important to recognise that it is change nonetheless – a pleasant surprise from a President who promised wealthy donors that “nothing would fundamentally change”.
