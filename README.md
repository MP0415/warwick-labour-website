# Warwick Labour Website Redesign

The warwick labour website https://warwicklabour.org is in need of a redesign. Using React I am developing a more modern, streamlined, informative website for the society.

## Old website design

## My website design

My design utilises bright, modern, blocky elements that utilise the entire width of the display. Extending the design style of the logo, triangular accents are added throughout the page to add a sense of cohesiveness. 

### Colours used

#ffffff
#917f82
#392d2f
#dd0025

## Removed elements

I have chosen to remove some elements of the old website: the google calender insert was not used and was confusing to page visitors, I plan to integrate either a static calendar or simply point members to our socials. The blog section has not been re-implemented simply due to inactivity, although I am thinking of a way to reintroduce this page if the society needs it. Finally, the democracy section has been removed. I plan to reintroduce a link to the constitution and although weekly minutes have not been uploaded to the website since 2019, I would not mind creating a new space for them if needed.
