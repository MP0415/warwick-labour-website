# Grace Lewis Climate Speech 

Delivered for Warwick and Leamington Climate Rally in Nov 2022. 

I don’t know the number of climate rallies or strikes I have been to. But the answer is, too many. Ever since I missed school in 2019 to stand in Manchester,  hundreds alongside hundreds of other young people for the first time fighting for climate justice, what progress has been made 3 years on. The answer … too little. I question whether we even made progress at all?? 

In a time when global temperatures, CO2 emissions, poverty and billionaire profits are rising, how can we say governments and corporations today are taking climate change and environmental devastation seriously. The answer: we can’t.

To stop this climate emergency we need to organise, we need to unite. That is why students like me will continue to fight. I am very grateful today to be joined by other members of Warwick Labour Society and some members of Warwick Greens society who like many across the country, share my sense of urgency in the matter. We see the victory in Brazil as a small glimmer of hope, not only for narrowing social equality, but for environmental justice. Protecting the Amazon is a great place to start, but to be truthful, it is not enough. We need action that ends injustice, that ends inequality. Action that ends this climate crisis.

Stood here today, we are somewhat privileged. We are not climate refugees fleeing from their homes because of flooding, we are not hospitalised from deadly air pollution, and we are not stood in dangerous life-threatening heats. We need to stand alongside those people and take action to protect them, to protect our future selves and our planet for generations to come. 

While energy companies are facing record breaking profits, people like you and I are faced with soaring energy bills. We shouldn’t have to be worried about staying warm this winter and we shouldn’t have to suffer the consequences of decisions made by big corporations in their own profiteering interest. We shouldn’t have to pay the price. Governments, big businesses and world leaders need to take responsibility now before it is too late.

Thankyou.
